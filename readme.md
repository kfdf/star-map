## Star Control 2/UQM resources map

Available [here](https://kfdf.github.io/star-map).

Drag to pan. Use the mouse wheel to zoom. Hover over a star to get a quick overview of the planets and moons in the star system. And that's all.

There is one row per planet/moon. Every row stars with an icon which roughly depicts the planet's size and color, and if it's a moon the icon is off centered. Then a three digit figure describes the planetary environment - thermal, weather and tectonic hazards. Then is the total mineral value of the planet, followed by the value per unit of volume, or '+' for non-signle digit values. And the final figure shows the total amount of bio data for the planet.

Holding down any (almost) key brings up this readme.

It's a webified version of an old project of mine. It seems like a near perfect fit for SVG, but I went with Canvas for this one. Hopefully, it is optimized enough to be smooth.
