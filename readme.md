## Star Control 2/UQM resources map

Available [here](https://kfdf.github.io/star-map).

Drag to pan. Mousewheel to zoom. Hover over a star to get a quick overview of the planets and moons in the star system. And that's all.

There is one row per planet/moon. Every row stars with an icon which roughly depicts the planet's size and color (if it's a moon, the icon is off centered). Then a three digit value describes the planetary environment - thermal, weather (always 8, the highest, for gas giants) and tectonic hazards. Then is the total mineral value of the planet, followed by the value per unit of volume, any value higher than nine is displayed as '+', but there is only one such value in the game (25). And the final value  shows the total amount of bio data for the planet.

Holding down any (almost) key brings up this readme.

It's a webified version of an old project of mine. It seems like a near perfect fit for SVG, but I went with Canvas for this one. Hopefully, it is optimized enough to be smooth.
